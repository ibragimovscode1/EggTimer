Eggs may seem like the simplest thing to cook, but at the same time it's often difficult to pinpoint exactly when to stop the cooking to get the egg exactly how you like it.

With the Egg timer your cooking will become more predictable. Your soft-boiled eggs will be a perfect dipping sauce for toasts, hard-boiled eggs will be tender for sandwiches or firm with creamy yolks for salads. Choose the type of boiled egg you want and add a protein boost to your healthy diet. Now you can try new recipes and explore versatile egg dishes while the egg timer takes care of the rest.

You can select:
- how you want it to be cooked
-  soft-boiled
-  medium-boiled
-  hard-boiled.

It has never been easier to enjoy your perfectly cooked eggs for breakfast or any time of the day.

Have fun when boiling eggs with Egg timer!
